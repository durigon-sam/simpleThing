# SimpleThing Code of Conduct

## Intro

As a simple program meant to do simple things, most users would think a code of conduct would not be necessary. However, the world is crazy
and we want to ensure that our project meets the standards and morals that we support for all people. This program is meant for all people of 
all ages, and that vision has never changed. We do not discriminate against age, race, gender, class, or any other life choice.
If you are human, enjoy the program! We are open to all, no matter what.

## Standards and Morals

We ask that all who use our simpleThing project in any way, shape, or form, adhere to the following:

* Be respectful to all people, places, and things, even if you do not agree with it
* Take responsibility for what you do. If you make a mistake, simply fix it and don't do it again
* If someone asks for help, don't be afraid to offer it
* If you are providing criticisms or compliments, make them helpful and constructive so that we may learn as a community how to better our work
* Be rootin
* Be tootin
* By God be shootin
* But most importantly
* Be kind :)

## Explicit Rules

* This project is meant for all people of all ages. Please refrain from curses, slurs, and slang language of any kind
* Humor is always appreciated, so long as it is within reasonable bounds. If you wouldn't say it in your daughter's kindergarten classroom,
please don't say it here. This includes racist, sexist, ageist, shapeist, religist, or ethnic jokes of any kind. Puns are a safe bet
* Do not include private information of any kind, whether it be your own or your greatest enemy's
* No harrassment of any kind, whether it be targeted or general. No exceptions
* Please keep political, religious, and ethnical beliefs or opinions out of our project. It does not belong here
* Don't be a jerk, no trolling or messing with a user or other contributor
* No advertising of any kind. We don't want to hear about your new pyramid scheme
* Anything else not listed that would be considered unproffesional. If you have to think about whether you can write it, you probably cannot

## Repercussions

If you are found breaking any of the above mentioned rules or engaging in behavior against our standards and morals, the following may occur:

* You will first be asked to remove the violation in question if it was written somewhere in the project. You will be given one 
chance to do so
* If you are caught practicing more behavior against our code, you will be banished and blacklisted from this and any future project 
promoted by us
* You only get one second chance. After that, no exceptions.
 
## Conclusion
We hope that you adhere to our code and support the betterment of our project for all people. We are one all one people, and we should support
each other as if we were one family. Thank you, and enjoy our project.
