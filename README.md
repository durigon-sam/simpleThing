## Code function:

This code will take a user's name and age as input and output how old they are in dog years.

Our Program calculates the user's age in dog years. First the program reads in the name of the user. Then it reads in the the age of the user. Next, it mutlitplies the age of the user by 7 to conver the user's age into dog years. Finnaly, the program prints out a statement with the user's name and the user's age in dog years. 

## Example Code of the program:

         age_years=int(input("How old are you in years?"))
    
This sample code demostrates the main function we use in our program. The input("String") function provides are text box for  the user  of the code to type in a string. The String within the parentheses of the function is the question coupled with the textbox   that gives context for the user of what to input into the textbox. Since the variable age_years is meant to be an int we convert the String the user entered into an int, by type casting it with the int() function. The other important piece of code which takes the user's name is very similar to the example code, except it does not use the int() becuase the user's name is meant to stay a string.
